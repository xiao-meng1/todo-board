# Todo-Board

This is an interactive dashboard web application inspired by Taskboard which implements create, read, update, and delete functionality for lists and tasks. The application logic was organized using a Model-View-Controller design pattern. Dates-fns was used to format and compare dates for rendering. The Web Storage API was used to store and retrieve the data model between sessions. Webpack was used to bundle source files into distribution files.
